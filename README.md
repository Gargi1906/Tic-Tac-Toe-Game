# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
A game designed inspired from the games we played back in childhood!

This repository contains a simple implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid until one of the players wins or the game ends in a draw.

# Features
1.Player vs Player: Two human players can play against each other.
2.Interactive Interface: The game provides a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
3.Win detection: The game detects when a player has won the game by getting three marks in a row, column, or diagonal.
4.Draw detection: The game detects when the board is full and no player has won, resulting in a draw.
5.Replayability: After a game ends, players have the option to start a new game.
